    <p>At AOD, your legacy can last for years ...</p>

    <p>Hello and welcome to our home on the Crystal Data Center and the Brynhildr Server!
        We're looking for new, veteran and returning players alike interested in mount / minion farms, map hunts,
        chocobo racing, SE events, our own social FC events - honestly any content from ARR through to preparing for
        Endwalker it's all on the table. And yes, we have members who do Savage content! Established in 2021, we have
        intentionally cultivated a community focused on less drama and more gaming. Here your relationships and
        investments within the community truly matter. And while victory is important to us all, we value the individual
        first - not individual skill. There are no minimum item level (ilvl) or job level (jlvl) requirements - everyone
        is welcome.</p>

        FC Events & Badges
    </h2>

    <p>Our FC runs all content from ARR through to anything and everything current. We actively participate in
        Square-Enix sponsored events and organize our own weekly and bi-weekly social events like mount and crafting
        farms. And if you're a collector or a completionist, we've badges galore you can earn that'll make your forum
        profile shine to go along with all those minions, mounts and that glorious end-game glamour.</p>

    <p>Our goal is to make sure no one plays alone. Need a hand grinding out a new job? We got you. Need a friend to
        help you with that Fate you want to clear? Again, we got you. Want someone to rage along with you about new raid
        mechanics? Yep, we got you there too. In fact, we encourage anyone and everyone we find playing alone to party
        up with our other members. No one beats a dungeon all by themselves nor should they. In AOD its about the
        community and we'd like for you to be a part of it.</p>
