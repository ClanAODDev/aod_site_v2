        Battles. We’re excited about the future of War Thunder.</p>
    <p>Our members are from around the globe with varying experience levels from beginners to level 100
        veterans. This is a place where people of equal caliber can play together and where newcomers can learn

    <p>Angels of Death competes in Realistic Squadron battles and consistently rank in the top 100 tier and we
        participate in large Gaijin-organized events. Such as World War Mod and Operation Summer to name a few.</p>
    <p>Super Squad Saturday is a monthly event hosted by AOD consisting of skill-based competition among our
        community of players, just for fun of course, with a few bragging rights here and there. Classic events
        include bombers versus biplanes, sea-plane racing on water, reserve tanks vs KV2s and air racing. No
        matter what the time we will almost always have people on line and willing to squad up.</p>
    <p>We value good sportsmanship and playing as a team over individual prowess.</p>
