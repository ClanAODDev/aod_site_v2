            <p>The Angels of Death operate five squadrons within War Thunder, comprising upwards of 300 full time
                players and more than 100 part-time players from other AOD divisions.</p>
            <p>We cover all aspects of the game, Arcade, Realistic and Simulator modes in Planes, Tanks, and Naval
                Battles. We’re excited about the future of War Thunder.</p>
            <p>Our members are from around the globe with varying experience levels from beginners to level 100
                veterans. This is a place where people of equal caliber can play together and where newcomers can learn
                and grow. Our forums contain a library of useful information from tank ammunition types, plane
                characteristics, and engagement tactics.</p>

            <p>Angels of Death competes in Realistic Squadron battles and consistently rank in the top 100 tier and
                unite for large Gaijin-organized events.</p>
            <p>Super Squad Saturday is a monthly event hosted by AOD consisting of skill-based competition among our
                community of players, just for fun of course, with a few bragging rights here and there. Classic events
                include bombers versus biplanes, sea-plane racing on water, reserve tanks vs KV2s and air racing. No
                matter what the time we will almost always have people on line and willing to squad up.</p>
            <p>We value good sportsmanship and playing as a team over individual prowess.</p>
