    <p><strong>Freedom. Peace. Democracy.</strong></p>
    <p>Enlist in the AOD Helldivers and join the fight for freedom across a hostile galaxy.
        We are a casual gaming group, and we accept players of all skill ranges. We don’t require meta builds or force a
        certain playstyle. We only ask two things: respect for your fellow Helldivers and have a good time gaming
        together. We endeavor to create a true community environment of good sportsmanship and absolute fun.</p>
