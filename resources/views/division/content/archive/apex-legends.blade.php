    <p>AOD Apex is primarily a casual gaming group that accepts players from all skill ranges. Having a good time
        playing together in a drama free environment, helping each other succeed and pushing forward to victory (or
        horrible, horrible defeat) is what we are all about. We support all Apex game modes - Pubs and Ranked BR, Arenas
        and Control. We are looking for mature, respectful players who want similar people to play with - regardless of
        skill. Is that you? Then read on, f√©lagi fighter.

    <p>We have people playing nightly in our channels - just load into the LFS Channel (Looking for Squad) and form a
        party for what game mode you are looking for. You can also join a Ranked or Pubs channel and ask for a spot in a
        squad. It is that simple and easy to join a game with fellow members. We have also run monthly/quarterly
        division events like Killathon and Apex Tournaments for our members.</p>
    <p>We are starting up our Apex Division again so we are a smaller group but we are hoping to grow into a larger one.
        If that interests you, please read on for the membership requirements.</p>
