        The AOD Squad division has our own server that we have populated daily with active squad leads and good
        listeners for your regular riflemen. The server features almost all Layers with RAAS and AAS game modes.<br>
        The server also features many custom triggers that ensure that the server is well organized. Engaging in
        fierce battles, we strive to forge a sense of companionship that could rival the military.</p>
