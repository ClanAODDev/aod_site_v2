    <p>Angels of Death has made up an influential portion of the Emerald population in PlanetSide 2 since the game
        launched. We “move the map” by controlling territory and capturing enemy facilities on a daily basis. Full
        members currently make up around 300 of the 10,000 plus in-game members who fight for the Terran Republic.
        Expect to see public platoons running during peak hours daily.</p>

        Servers and Events
    </h2>

    <p>The Angels of Death operate exclusively on the Emerald server.</p>

    <p>Weekly Operations on Sundays and Mondays, from <strong>8 pm to 10 pm EST</strong>, are run with two or more open
        platoons. These
        are lead by our senior leadership with a complete chain of command to try to take over the map. In addition, we
        also have our Reaper Special Operations Group working in conjunction with the platoons to be our spear while our
        platoons are the sledgehammer.</p>
    <p>There are also a host of events every day, throughout the week, and larger full-member & community events every
        month.</p>

    <p>AOD’s PlanetSide Officer Corps are available daily to assist full members with game-related questions. They also
        conduct scheduled training classes for a variety of topics including platoon leading and strategies, Basic
        infantry skills and class load-outs, air vehicle piloting and specifications, armor specifications and
        deployment, and other topics as requested by our members. With many of us playing since Beta, there is a wealth
        of knowledge to be shared with our many tenured members.</p>
