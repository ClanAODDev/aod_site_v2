    <p>Angels of Death has made up an influential portion of the Emerald population in Planetside 2 since the
        game launched. We “move the map” by controlling territory and capturing enemy facilities on a daily
        basis. Full members currently make up around 350 of the nearly 3,700 in-game members who fight for the
        Terran Republic faction. Expect to see a platoon running during peak hours and multiple platoons during
        our Ops event every Sunday night.</p>

    </h2>

    <p>The Angels of Death operate exclusively on the Emerald server.</p>
    <p>The team holds weekly operations on Sundays and Mondays from <strong>8pm to 10pm ET</strong>. Sundays are
        open platoons where anyone is invited to join to see how AOD controls much of the battlefield under the
        guidance of our senior members. Monday Ops are “Full Member” only with all participants in TeamSpeak,
        enabling us to move more quickly, strike harder, and do more complex maneuvers. In addition, we often
        have a Spec Ops team working in conjunction with the platoon on Sunday and Monday nights. Spec Ops squad
        compositions vary week to week rotating between specialized infantry, air support and armor squads.</p>
    <p>AOD’s Planetside 2 Officer Team and Trainers are available daily to assist full members with game related
        questions. They also conduct scheduled training classes for a variety of topics including: Platoon
        Leading and Strategies, Basic Infantry Skills and Class Loadouts, Air Vehicle Piloting and
        Specifications, Armor specifications and deployment, and other topics as requested by our members. With
        many of us playing since Beta, there is a wealth of knowledge to be shared.</p>
