<p>With an active presence in PlanetSide dating back to 2003, AOD is the top outfit for players looking for a fun, casual gaming environment where they can play alongside dozens of members in an organized fashion. We specialize in operating large forces alongside specialized, cohesive squads in a coordinated manner to control territory. With public platoons running during primetime daily, we'd love for you to hop in and play with us, join us as an outfit member in-game, or even in TeamSpeak as a full-member. Players of all skill levels will find a home where they can play, improve, get involved in the community, and have fun!</p>
<p>Founded in 1999, the Angels of Death are a large multi-gaming clan. Beyond PlanetSide, we have over 1,000 active members fully supporting over 7 different titles, all with dedicated leadership, officers, and members. When it comes to online gaming communities, you won't find any other organization with the same scale, longevity, organization, and casual environment that has caused many people to call AOD home for decades. We support our operations with our own Forums, TeamSpeak, and Discord.</p>

        Events
    </h2>

    <p>The Angels of Death operate exclusively on the Emerald server.</p>

    <p>Weekly Operations on Sundays and Mondays, from <strong>8 pm to 10 pm EST</strong>, are run with two or more open
        platoons. These
        are lead by our senior leadership with a complete chain of command to try to take over the map. In addition, we
        also have our Reaper Special Operations Group working in conjunction with the platoons to be our spear while our
        platoons are the sledgehammer.</p>
    <p>There are also a host of events every day, throughout the week, and larger full-member & community events every
        month.</p>

    <p>AODâ€™s PlanetSide Officer Corps are available daily to assist full members with game-related questions. They also
        conduct scheduled training classes for a variety of topics including platoon leading and strategies, Basic
        infantry skills and class load-outs, air vehicle piloting and specifications, armor specifications and
        deployment, and other topics as requested by our members. With many of us playing since Beta, there is a wealth
        of knowledge to be shared with our many tenured members.</p>
