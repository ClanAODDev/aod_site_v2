    <p>The Diablo Division is one of AOD’s newer divisions which was created with the launch of Diablo 4. The Diablo
        Division is growing and we have a range of players from those working their first characters through the Story
        line to those grinding levels to reach 100.</p>
    <p>You can always find someone to run Hell Tides, Capstones, Grim
        Favors, World Boss/Legion Events as well as those who are grinding NighMare dungeons for XP, Gear and Glyph XP.
        With all the different ways one can build their characters, it’s great to have a group of players to bounce
        ideas off and try new things with.</p>

        Seasons, Battlepasses and PvP
    </h2>

    <p>We are looking forward to the upcoming seasons and to see how Blizzard plans to introduce them. What kind of
        adventures will they have? Plus there is the Battle Pass that they have promised to introduce as well. What
        will that give us? Come join us and let’s explore the future of Sanctuary together. Most of the Division
        plays PvE, but once the Seasons start off and get going, we intend to start delving into the world of PvP in
        Diablo. PvP will offer a break from grinding new seasonal characters and enjoy a different aspect of game
        play Diablo offers.
