The Angels of Death currently operates four squadrons within War Thunder, comprising upwards of 300 full time players and more than 100 part-time players from other AOD divisions.

We cover all aspects of the game - Arcade, Realistic and Simulator modes in Planes, Tanks, Helicopters and Ships. We’re excited about the future of War Thunder.

Our members are from around the globe with varying experience levels from beginners to level 100 veterans. This is a place where people of equal caliber can play together and where newcomers can learn and grow. Our forums contain a library of useful information including guides on tank ammunition types, plane characteristics, engagement tactics and much more.

EVENTS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES
---------------------------

Angels of Death actively competes in Realistic Squadron Battles. In addition AOD also takes part in various Community and Gaijin hosted events like World War Mode, Tournaments and Grind events to name a few.

Super Squad Saturday is a monthly event hosted by AOD consisting of skill-based competition among our community of players, just for fun of course, with a few bragging rights here and there. Classic events include bombers versus biplanes, sea-plane racing on water, reserve tanks vs KV2s and air racing. No matter what the time is there are always people on line to play, squad up and talk with.

We value good sportsmanship and playing as a team over individual prowess.
