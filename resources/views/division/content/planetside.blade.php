    <p>With an active presence in PlanetSide dating back to 2003, AOD is the top outfit for players looking for a fun,
        casual gaming environment where they can play alongside dozens of members in an organized fashion. We specialize
        in operating large forces alongside specialized, cohesive squads in a coordinated manner to control territory.
        With recurring events throughout the week, we'd love for you to hop in and play with us, join us as an
        outfit member in-game, or even in Discord as a full-member. Players of all skill levels will find a home where
        they can play, improve, get involved in the community, and have fun!</p>
    <p><strong>AOD plays as the Terran Republic on Emerald (US East)</strong>.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1999, the Angels of Death are a large multi-gaming clan. Beyond PlanetSide, we have over 1,000 active
        members fully supporting multiple titles across many genres, all with dedicated leadership, officers, and members. When it
        comes to online gaming communities, you won't find any other organization with the same scale, longevity,
        organization, and casual environment that has caused many people to call AOD home for decades. We support our
        operations with our own Forums and Discord.</p>

        Events
    </h2>

    <h3>Weekly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infantry Practice</strong>: Our Reaper team specializes in cohesive infantry gameplay. Outside of
            Ops, they hold a weekly practice where new players can learn higher level infantry play from the basics to
            the complex, and seasoned players can brush up on their abilities.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Vehicle Practice</strong>: Our Guardian Angel team specializes in coordinated armor/air gameplay.
            Outside of Ops, they hold a weekly practice where members can learn the intricacies of working well in
            driver-gunner teams, or holding their own in an armor squad with proper teamwork.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Platoon/Squad Leading Class</strong>: We offer a comprehensive program that can take a complete
            newcomer to leading in-game and guide them through all facets of platoon & squad leading. From how to start
            up a squad, managing a platoon, reading the map, special tactics, and hands on mentorship with real-time
            feedback to help you improve.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Off Faction Night</strong>: To switch things up, we'll spend an evening on NC or VS and get a feel
            for the other faction's arsenals and gameplay. We offer NC and VS outfits for our members to join.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Weekly Operations</strong>: The main event of the week! Every Sunday & Monday, we all get together operate multiple platoons in conjunction with our Reaper & Guardian Special Operation
            Groups under a force commander, with officers as platoon and squad leads. AOD conducts Ops with scale and
            coordination that no other outfit can match, and we dominate whatever continent we're on for two hours.
        </li>
    </ul>
