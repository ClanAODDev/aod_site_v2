    <p>The division currently maintains one server for Battlefield 4 (AOD Stomping Grounds) while we gear up for the
        release of Battlefield 2042. During our weekly Friday Night Battlefield event we may also fire up a Battlefield
        V server for some shenanigans! If community servers are available in BF2042, you can be sure that the AOD
        Stomping Grounds will be right there in your server browser.</p>
    <p>Our community events range from scheduled matches to impromptu fun; highlighting both the regular game modes and
        those we’ve engineered ourselves. We’re always looking for new and fun ways to keep things interesting. We have
        also hosted VIP events like hosting the developers at DICE for some good old-fashioned Conquest battles.
