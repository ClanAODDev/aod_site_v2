                Servers and Events
            </h2>

            <p>The division currently maintains 2 servers for Battlefield 1. Our AOD BF1 servers have been favorited
                over 40,000 times since launch. When rental servers are available in Battlefield V, you can be sure that
                the AOD Stomping Grounds will be right there in your server browser.</p>
            <p>Our community events range from scheduled matches to impromptu fun; highlighting both the regular game
                modes and those we’ve engineered ourselves. We’re always looking for new and fun ways to keep things
                interesting. From time to time, we also host VIP events like hosting the developers at DICE for some
                good old-fashioned Conquest battles.</p>
