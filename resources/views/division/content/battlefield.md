We are first-most a casual gaming group and we accept players of all skill ranges. Respect for your fellow clan-mates, Battlefield players, and having a good time gaming together are what we are all about. We endeavor to create a true community environment of good sportsmanship and absolute fun. Our passion for developing community has helped establish AOD Battlefield servers as some of the most prominent and popular Battlefield servers in North America. Whether you’re here to relax with friends or get PTFO sweaty, you will always find
someone to squad up with in Clan AOD.

##   Servers and Events

A few times a week, we will run a Portal Server in Battlefield 2042. Our main event is Friday Evening (AOD FNB - BF2042). Search for ***AOD Stomping Grounds - Full Progression*** in your BF2042 Portal Server Browser to find us.
    
Our community events range from scheduled matches to impromptu fun; highlighting both the regular game modes and those we’ve engineered ourselves. We’re always looking for new and fun ways to keep things interesting. We have also hosted VIP events like hosting the developers at DICE for some good old-fashioned Conquest battles and playing with some of the Mods of r/Battlefield2042 and other Battlefield subreddits.
