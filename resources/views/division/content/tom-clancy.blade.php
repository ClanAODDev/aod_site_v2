            <p>Welcome to the Tom Clancy division of Angels of Death, the home of Rainbow Six Siege and The
                Division. We combine the best of each game into one place for your ultimate enjoyment, whether that
                be some casual gaming, ranked sessions or taking on the harder content with your fellow agents.</p>

                Servers and Events
            </h2>

            <p>Each game has their own dedicated channels within Team Speak for members to team up (LFG channel)
                with additional channels for formed groups to drop into to complete the various activities within
                each game.</p>
            <p>We strive to ensure we have something for every member, regardless of their game experience. Every
                member is supported in game and encouraged to submit ideas for activities that will make our gaming
                experience more enjoyable and ensure the TC Division continues to grow within the AOD community.
                Weekly events are held, in specially named channels, covering a wide range of content for both our
                inexperienced and experienced members.</p>
            <p>Come and join us in destroying the various factions that threaten the stability of Manhattan (both
                PvE and PvP) so we can take back New York in The Division. Jump into Rainbow Six Siege for some
                casual or ranked matches and not forgetting our popular AOD vs AOD fun nights… Sledge and seek
                anyone?</p>
            <p>Hope to see you in game Agent!</p>
