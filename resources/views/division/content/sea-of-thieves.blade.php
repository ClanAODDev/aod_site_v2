            <p>We use TeamSpeak 3 for voice chat. Our crew-mates hail from the four corners of the globe with
                varying
                levels of experience from beginners, just gaining their sea legs, to veterans that can drink anyone
                else
                under the table. This is a place where people with equal wit and charm can sail together and
                landlubbers
                can learn how to be the scurviest of pirates. Our forums contain countless tomes of useful
                information
                and resources. Our goal is for name “Angels of Death” to be respected by our peers and feared by our
                enemies.</p>

            <p>One of the best parts about sailing with AOD is that you’ll never sail alone. The open sea is a
                dangerous
                place, and you can be certain that when trouble finds ya, your clan mates will have your back. We
                meet
                at the tavern and play informally on a daily basis as a well oiled machine on the high seas. AOD
                also
                conducts routine training as needed for a variety of topics, such as navigation, ship piloting,
                combat
                training, and other topics as requested by our mates. Every legendary pirate lord has to start
                somewhere, right?</p>
